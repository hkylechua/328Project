Overview:
HeartFit is a health application that tracks a personâ€™s acceleration data from a wearable or mobile device during their workout session to ensure they are making the most out of their exercise. 

A person can choose a low, moderate, or vigorous workout session. Doctors may advise patients to stick to light or moderate exercise in many cases such as recovering from injuries, dealing with chronic illness, or due to pregnancy or old age. On the other hand, many users may want to increase their workout intensity, such as athletes training to hit a certain goal, marathoners, or those looking to lose weight and improve overall fitness. 

Using a variety of training data, based on walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, core-strength exercises, and stretching, we have developed a classifier which determines if a workout is of desired intensity.

Our application will send real-time messages advising the user to slow down if they are above their target range or put more effort if performing below their target range. 

Steps to use HeartFit:
1. Download the sensor logger application, and enable the collection of accelerometer data 
2. Connect sensor logger to a laptop or mobile device
3. When prompted, enter your goal workout intensity (low, moderate, or vigorous)
4. Start recording data 
5. View browser for a graph of your accelerometer data and messages regarding workout intensity 
6. Stop recording data when workout is compeleted
